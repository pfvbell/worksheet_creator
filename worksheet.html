        <p>An algorithm should be seen as a starting point before writing a program. It should include the required programming constructs to solve the problem, ie sequence, selection and iteration. The finished program should follow the steps the algorithm describes.  Before an algorithm can be designed, it is important to check that the problem is completely decomposed. You can find out more about decomposition on page 10 of this study guide. </p>what should be seen as a starting point before writing a program?</p><p>How do you check that an algorithm is completely decomposed?</p><p>what should be the final program?</p><p>what is the decomposition of an algorithm?</p><p>what should be included in an algorithm?</p></body>
