        <p>Although Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, there was only a small amount of fighting. The SS Athenia, a British ship, was sunk by a German U-boat while transporting evacuees to Canada. France made a small-scale attempt to attack Germany through the Saar region, but this was soon abandoned. This period of time is often referred to as the ‘Phoney War’.  People in Britain had expected bombing and fighting to start straight away, but it did not. The ‘Phoney War’ ended in April 1940, when Germany invaded Norway. Britain took military action to try and support Norway against Hitler’s invasion, but they failed. This failure was debated by MPs in the House of Commons shortly after. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was strongly criticised for the failure during the debate. He was unable to form a government that would support him, so he had to resign. He was replaced by Winston Churchill in May 1940.</p>
